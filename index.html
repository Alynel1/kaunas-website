      <h2>The History of Kaunas</h2>
      <p>
       Kaunas was one of the most important city in Lithuania, known as the time as The Grand Duchy
        of Lithuania (1236-1795). It was also the Capital of Kaunas Governorate during the Russian
        empire domination (1843-1915).
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it has a nice history, Kaunas is mostly and sadly known because of its importance
        during the Nazi and USSR domination. In fact, The Kovno Ghetto established by the Nazi was one 
        of the most importantr in the region. At its peak, nearly 29 000 people were held inside. Most of
        them were later sent to concentration or extermination camps, or were shot at the Ninth Fort, another
        sadly known monument in Kaunas.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the Sobiet domination Period (1945-1991), Kaunas was one of the most rebellious city of the 
        eastern block, with a guerilla warfare which only ended in 1953 but the opposition to Soviet
        rule didn't stop until the independence of Lithuania, February 13, 1991.
